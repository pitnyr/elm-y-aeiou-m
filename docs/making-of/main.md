## Setup

I want everything to be done on feature branches, so the first commit is empty:

[commit-2022-03-07-14-34-33](https://github.com/pitnyr/elm-y-aeiou-m/commit/2bb76ea34ce00e22b6e36069aaed2a6b379497e8)
```email
subject: Add empty root commit
```

<a id="commit-2022-03-07-17-12"></a>

The remaining setup is handled in feature branch [setup](setup.md).

[commit-2022-03-07-17-12](https://github.com/pitnyr/elm-y-aeiou-m/commit/dd94956a9a897281e8694a90980538feb397a786)
```email
subject: Merge branch 'setup'

Setup the project structure.
```


## Implement basic idea of Haskell intro in Elm

I found the basic idea well explained here:
<https://wiki.haskell.org/IO_inside>.

I'll try to implement the code in feature branch [basic](basic.md).

```email

Implemented the basic idea of the Haskell intro in Elm.
The Haskell code is at https://wiki.haskell.org/IO_inside.
